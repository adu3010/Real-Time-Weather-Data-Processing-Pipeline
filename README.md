# Real-Time-Weather-Data-Processing-Pipeline

I developed a real-time data pipeline using Python, integrating OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and process weather data. Implemented multi-threading for parallel processing and real-time visualization of temperature and humidity trends.

The project used multi-threading to handle concurrent data fetching and processing, ensuring smooth performance. The pipeline included real-time visualization of temperature and humidity trends.

# Libraries Used:
Requests: To fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Threading: For parallel processing of data in producer-consumer architecture.
Pandas: For data manipulation and organization.
